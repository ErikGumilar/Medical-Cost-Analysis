# Medical-Cost-Analysis
Hi there!!!<span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

In Indonesia :indonesia: , in the last few months a surprising event occurred and for the first time the BPJS Kesehatan budget did not experience a deficit. When BPJS Kesehatan was first launched in 2014, BPJS Kesehatan experienced a very large deficit, causing the Central Government to inject funds into the health aid agency.  

Here I am as one of the Business Intelligence team, trying to provide an overview and input to ABC company which is engaged in the insurance business. 
So from the analysis provided, it is hoped that the company will not experience a similar incident with the government aid agency.
